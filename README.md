# Implementation-of-noisy_channel_model-for-neural-machine-translation
Developed a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system using a noisy channel model to enhance translation quality. Integrated a direct model (p(y|x)), channel model (p(x|y)), and language model (p(y)) with beam search decoding. Used pre-trained models for English-Hindi translation, including Helsinki-NLP's translation models and ai4bharat's IndicBART for language modeling. Evaluated performance using BLEU scores and visualized the contribution of each model component. The project demonstrated the feasibility of combining traditional noisy channel methods with modern NMT architectures for improved translations, with future work focusing on model optimization and advanced decoding techniques.
